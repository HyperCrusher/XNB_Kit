# XNB_Kit
XNB Unpacker and Repacker is a tool for use in Stardew-Valley or similar titles that use XNB format to unpack and repack the resource files. The program is really simple and is simply a interface wrapped around command line resources produced by the community. I have no special involvment besides giving more people the ability to use these tools.
